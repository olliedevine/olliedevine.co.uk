                This website, a personal passion-project, serves as a base for everything I output. On here you can find everything I do (at least, everything I do that's worthwhile).<br><br>
                The entire website is 100% DIY:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All the HTML, CSS, JS and PHP is written from scratch by me
                </li>
                <li>
                    I host the site myself on Microsoft IIS, which is running on a webserver that I built
                </li>
                <li>
                    I own the domain and manage the DNS records myself
                </li>
                <li>
                    I manage the network port forwarding, security, etc
                </li>
                <li>
                    I even carry out my own SEO; a Google search of my name brings up this site!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This website helps me practice new web technologies as I learn them and serves as a perpetually evolving demonstration of my capabilities to create content on the world wide web.
                It also provides a creative outlet; I have put care, attention and effort into the aesthetics and functionality of the website, and I also use the website to display some of my other work and work by others that I enjoy.
